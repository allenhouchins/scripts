Each layer of protection is comprised of one or more malicious code protection mechanisms, which are automatically implemented and which, collectively, meet the requirements of all applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for malicious code prevention.\n1. This  first layer of defense targets the distribution of malware; the aim is to prevent malware from ever launching.\nThe following mechanisms are inherent to the macOS design and constitute the first layer of protection against malicious code:\nThe Apple App Store: the safest way to add new applications to a Mac is by downloading them from the App Store; all apps available for download from the App Store have been reviewed for signs of tampering and signed by Apple to indicate that the app meets security requirements and does\
    \ not contain malware.\nXProtect: a built-in, signature-based, anti-virus, anti-malware technology inherent to all Macs. XProtect automatically detects and blocks the execution of known malware.\nIn macOS 10.15 and all subsequent releases, XProtect checks for known malicious content when:\nan app is first launched,\nan app has been changed (in the file system), and\nXProtect signatures are updated.\nYARA: another built-in tool (inherent to all Macs), which conducts signature-based detection of malware. Apple updates YARA rules regularly.\nGatekeeper: a security feature inherent to all Macs; Gatekeeper scans apps to detect malware and/or revocations of a developer's signing certificate and prevents unsafe apps from running.\nNotarization: Apple performs regular, automated scans to detect signs of malicious content and to verify developer ID-signed software; when no issues are found, Apple notarizes the software and delivers the results of scans to the system owner.\n2. The second layer\
    \ of defense targets malware that manages to appear on a Mac before it runs; the aim is to quickly identify and block any malware present on a Mac in order to prevent the malware from running and further spreading.\nThe following mechanisms are inherent to the macOS design and constitute the second layer of protection against malicious code:\nXProtect (defined above).\nGatekeeper (defined above).\nNotarization (defined above).\n3.  The third layer of defense targets infected Mac system(s); the aim is to remediate Macs on which malware has managed to successfully execute.\nThe following mechanism is inherent to the macOS design and constitutes the third layer of protection against malicious code:\n*\tApple's XProtect: a technology included on all macOS systems.

Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled
    areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.

    Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.

    Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to its network and impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system.'

Valid inputs are likely to vary from field to field within a software application. Applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters
    that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing them to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation ensures accurate and correct inputs and prevents attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.'

However, NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5) contains a broad set of guidelines that attempt to address all aspects of an information system or systems within an organization. Because the macOS Security Compliance Project is tailored specifically to macOS, some requirements defined in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5) are not applicable.

    This supplemental contains those controls that are assigned to a baseline in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5) which cannot be addressed with a technical configuration for macOS. These controls can be accomplished though administrative or procedural processes within an organization or via integration of the macOS system into enterprise information systems which are configured to protect the systems within.

  name: macOS Security - FileVault Supplemental
  platforms: macOS
  platform: darwin
  description: 'The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:

    * systemsettingsfilevaultenforce

    In macOS the internal Apple File System (APFS) data volume can be protected by FileVault. The system volume is always cryptographically protected (T2 and Apple Silicon) and is a read-only volume.

    NOTE: FileVault uses an AES-XTS data encryption algorithm to protect full volumes of internal and external storage. Macs with a secure enclave (T2 and Apple Silicon) utilize the hardware security features of the architecture.

    FileVault is described in detail here: link:https://support.apple.com/guide/security/volume-encryption-with-filevault-sec4c6dc1b6e/web[].

    FileVault can be enabled in two ways within the macOS. It can be managed using the fdesetup command or by a Configuration Profile. When enabling FileVault via either of the aforementioned methods, you will be required to enter a username and password, which must be a local Open Directory account with a valid SecureToken password.

    [discrete]

    ==== Using the fdesetup Command

    When enabling FileVault via the command line in the Terminal application, you can run the following command.

    /usr/bin/fdesetup enable

    Running this command will prompt you for a username and password and then enable FileVault and return the personal recovery key. There are a number of management features available when managing FileVault via the command line that are not available when using a configuration profile. More information on these management features is available in the man page for fdesetup.

    NOTE: Apple has deprecated fdesetup command line tool from recognizing user name and password for security reasons and may remove the ability in future versions of macOS.

    [discrete]

    ==== Using a Configuration Profile

    When managing FileVault with a configuration profile, you must deploy a profile with the payload type com.apple.MCX.FileVault2. When using the Enable key to enable FileVault with a configuration profile, you must include 1 of the following:

    <key>Enable</key>

    <string>On</string>

    <key>Defer</key>

    <true/>

    <key>Enable</key>

    <string>On</string>

    <key>UserEntersMissingInfo</key>

    <true/>

    If using the Defer key it will prompt for the user name and password at logout.

    The UserEntersMissingInfo key will only work if installed through manual installation, and it will prompt for the username and password immediately.

    When using a configuration profile, you can escrow the Recovery key to a Mobile Device Management (MDM) server. Documentation for that can be found on Apple''s Developer site: link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/fderecoverykeyescrow[].

    It''s recommended that you use a Personal Recovery key instead of an Institutional key as it will generate a specific key for each device. You can find more guidance on choosing a recover key here: link:https://docs.jamf.com/technical-papers/jamf-pro/administering-filevault-macos/10.7.1/ChoosingaRecoveryKey.html[].

    NOTE: On Intel Macs, FileVault only supports password-based unlock and cannot be done using a smartcard. Smartcard unlock for FileVault is supported on Apple Silicon Macs.'

  name: macOS Security - Packet Filter (pf) Supplemental
  platforms: macOS
  platform: darwin
  description: 'The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:

    osfirewalldefaultdenyrequire

    macOS contains an application layer firewall (ALF) and a packet filter (PF) firewall.

    The ALF can block incoming traffic on a per-application basis and prevent applications from gaining control of network ports, but it cannot be configured to block outgoing traffic.

    * More information on the ALF can be found here: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201642

    The PF firewall can manipulate virtually any packet data and is highly configurable.

    ** More information on the BF firewall can be found here: https://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/index.html

    Below is a script that configures ALF and the PF firewall to meet the requirements defined in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5). The script will make sure the application layer firewall is enabled, set logging to "detailed", set built-in signed applications to automatically receive incoming connections, and set downloaded signed applications to automatically receive incoming connections. It will then create a custom rule set and copy com.apple.pfctl.plis from /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ into the /Library/LaunchDaemons folder and name it 800-53.pfctl.plist. This is done to not conflict with the system''s pf ruleset.

    The custom pf rules are created at /etc/pf.anchors/80053pf_anchors.

    The ruleset will block connections on the following ports:

    ==== Smartcard Pairing

    The default method for using smartcards in macOS is a method called "local account pairing". Local account pairing is automatically initiated when a user inserts a smartcard into the Mac. The user is prompted to pair their smartcard with their account. If a user receives a new smartcard, the previous card must be unpaired, and the new card paired to the account. Local account pairing employs fixed key mapping with the hash of a public key on the user''s smartcard with a local account.

    [discrete]

    ==== Smartcard Attribute Mapping

    Smartcards can be used to authenticate against a directory via attribute mapping configured in /private/etc/SmartcardLogin.plist. This file takes precedence over local account pairing. Attribute mapping matches the configured certificate field values from the smart card to the value in a directory. This may be used with network accounts, mobile accounts, or local accounts.

    ==== Smartcard Management in macOS

    The following settings are available to manage smartcards (com.apple.security.smartcard):

    [%header,cols="2,1,7"]

    |===

    |Key

    |Type

    |Value

    <.^|userPairing

    ^.^|bool

    |If false, users will not get the pairing dialog, although existing pairings will still work.

    <.^|allowSmartCard

    ^.^|bool

    |If false, the SmartCard is disabled for logins, authorizations, and screensaver unlocking. It is still allowed for other functions, such as signing emails and web access. A restart is required for a change of setting to take effect.

    <.^|checkCertificateTrust

    ^.^|int

    a|Valid values are 0-3:

    - 0: certificate trust check is turned off

    - 1: certificate trust check is turned on. Standard validity check is being performed but this does not include additional revocation checks.

    - 2: certificate trust check is turned on, and a soft revocation check is performed. Until the certificate is explicitly rejected by CRL/OCSP, it is considered valid. This implies that unavailable/unreachable CRL/OCSP allows this check to succeed.

    - 3: certificate trust check is turned on, plus a hard revocation check is performed. Unless CRL/OCSP explicitly states that "this certificate is OK", the certificate is considered invalid. This is the most secure value for this setting.

    <.^|oneCardPerUser

    ^.^|bool

    |If true, a user can pair with only one smartcard, although existing pairings will be allowed if already set up.

    <.^|enforceSmartCard

    ^.^|bool

    |If true, a user can only login or authenticate with a smartcard.

    <.^|tokenRemovalAction

    ^.^|int

    |If 1, the screen saver will automatically when the smartcard is removed.

    <.^|allowUnmappedUsers

    ^.^|int

    |If 1, allows users who are in a directory group to be exempt from smartcard-only enforcement. The group allowed for exemption is defined in /private/etc/SmartcardLogin.plist

    |===

    A custom configuration profile (com.apple.loginwindow) should be created to disable automatic login when FileVault is enabled. This ensures that authorized users boot their Macs, enter a password at the pre-boot screen (which decrypts the boot volume), and are then presented with a login window where they can authenticate with a smartcard.

    [%header,cols="2,1,7"]

    |===

    |Key

    |Type

    |Value

    <.^|DisableFDEAutoLogin

    ^.^|bool

    |If true, both Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) login password and loginwindow PIN are required.

    |===

    NOTE: DisableFDEAutoLogin does not have to be set on Apple Silicon based macOS systems that are smartcard enforced as smartcards are available at pre-boot.

    [discrete]

    ==== Trusted Authorities

    The macOS allows users to specify which certificate authorities (CA) can be used for trust evaluation during smartcard authentication. Only CAs listed in the TrustedAuthorities section of the SmartcardLogin.plist will be evaluated as trusted. This setting only works if checkCertificateTrust is set to either 1, 2, or 3 in com.apple.security.smartcard.

    To get the SHA-256 hash in the correct format, run the following command within terminal:

    /usr/bin/openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in <issuer cert> | /usr/bin/awk -F ''='' ''{print $2}'' |  /usr/bin/sed ''s/://g''

    To configure Trusted Authorities, the SmartcardLogin.plist should be minimally configured as below:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

    <plist version="1.0">

    <dict>

    <key>AttributeMapping</key>

    <dict>

    <key>fields</key>

    <array>

    <string>NT Principal Name</string>

    </array>

    <key>formatString</key>

    <string>Kerberos:$1</string>

    <key>dsAttributeString</key>

    <string>dsAttrTypeStandard:AltSecurityIdentities</string>

    </dict>

    <key>TrustedAuthorities</key>

    <array>

    <string>SHA256HASHOFCERTDOMAIN1,SHA256HASHOFCERTDOMAIN2</string>

    </array>

    </dict>

    </plist>

    [discrete]

    ==== Smartcard Enforcement Exemption

    [discrete]

    ===== Group Exemption

    Starting in macOS 10.15, enforcement on a system can be granularly configured by adding a field to /private/etc/SmartcardLogin.plist. The NotEnforcedGroup can be added to the file to list a Directory group that will not be included in smartcard enforcement. In order to activate this feature, enforceSmartCard and allowUnmappedUsers must be applied via a configuration profile (com.apple.security.smartcard).

    To configure the NotEnforcedGroup, the SmartcardLogin.plist should be minimally configured as follows:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

    <plist version="1.0">

    <dict>

    <key>AttributeMapping</key>

    <dict>

    <key>fields</key>

    <array>

    <string>NT Principal Name</string>

    </array>

    <key>formatString</key>

    <string>Kerberos:$1</string>

    <key>dsAttributeString</key>

    <string>dsAttrTypeStandard:AltSecurityIdentities</string>

    </dict>

    <key>TrustedAuthorities</key>

    <array>

    <string>SHA256HASHOFCERTDOMAIN1,SHA256HASHOFCERTDOMAIN2</string>

    </array>

    <key>NotEnforcedGroup</key>

    <string>EXEMPTGROUP</key>

    </dict>

    </plist>

    Once a system is configured for the NotEnforcedGroup a user can be added to the assigned group by running the following:

    /usr/sbin/dseditgroup -o edit -a <exemptuser> -t user <notenforcegroup>

    [discrete]

    ===== User Exemption

    Alternatively, if a single user needs to be exempt for a period of time, kDSNativeAttrTypePrefix:SmartCardEnforcement can be set in the user''s Open Directory record. The following values can be set:

    0 - The system default is respected.

    1 - Smartcard enforcement is enabled.

    * 2 - Smartcard enforcement is disabled.

    NOTE: In Active Directory environments, the value of the userAccountControl attribute is respected.

    Run the following command to set the exemption when booted from macOS:

    /usr/bin/dscl . -append /Users/<username> SmartCardEnforcement 2

    Run the following command to set the exemption when booted from Recovery:

    /usr/bin/defaults write /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/<username> SmartCardEnforcement -array-add 2

    NOTE: When booted to recovery on an Apple Silicon Mac, run the following after setting the exemption.

    /usr/sbin/diskutil apfs updatePreboot /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD

    [discrete]

    ===== Temporary Exemption

    On an Apple Silicon Mac, if a temporary exemption is needed, security filevault skip-sc-enforcement will disable smartcard enforcement on next boot only.

    Run the following command to set the temporary exemption when booted from Recovery:

    /usr/bin/security filevault skip-sc-enforcement <data volume UUID> set

    To obtain the data volume UUID run the following:

    /usr/sbin/diskutil apfs listGroups | /usr/bin/awk -F: ''/ Data/ { getline; gsub(/ /,""); print $2}''

    [discrete]

    ==== Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM)

    Terminal sessions in macOS can be configured for smartcard enforcement by modifying the PAM modules for sudo, su, and login.

    /etc/pam.d/sudo

    # sudo: auth account password session

    auth        sufficient    pamsmartcard.so

    auth        required      pamopendirectory.so

    auth        required      pamdeny.so

    account     required      pampermit.so

    password    required      pamdeny.so

    session     required      pampermit.so

    /etc/pam.d/su

    # su: auth account password session

    auth        sufficient    pamsmartcard.so

    auth        required      pamrootok.so

    auth        required      pamgroup.so nowarn group=admin,wheel ruser rootonly failsafe

    account     required      pampermit.so

    account     required      pamopendirectory.so nocheckshell

    password    required      pamopendirectory.so

    session     required      pamlaunchd.so

    /etc/pam.d/login

    # login: auth account password session

    auth        sufficient    pamsmartcard.so

    auth        optional      pamkrb5.so usekcminit

    auth        optional      pamntlm.so tryfirstpass

    auth        optional      pammount.so tryfirstpass

    auth        required      pamopendirectory.so tryfirstpass

    auth        required      pamdeny.so

    account     required      pamnologin.so

    account     required      pamopendirectory.so

    password    required      pamopendirectory.so

    session     required      pamlaunchd.so

    session     required      pamuwtmp.so

    session     optional      pammount.so

    ==== Screen Sharing and Screen Recording

    macOS will disable support for TouchID, Watch, or Smartcard authentication when being watched or recorded. This can cause certain portions of the system to not recognize your smartcard.

    In Unified Logging you''ll notice an entry such as

    2022-07-14 16:45:46.880038-0400 0x2F97 Info 0xC8D2 1600 SecurityAgent: (SecurityAgent) [com.apple.Authorization:SecurityAgent] Screen is being watched, no Touch ID, Watch or SmartCard support is allowed

    This can be remediated by writing the preference domain com.apple.authorization with the key ignoreARD.

    defaults write com.apple.Authorization ignoreARD -bool true

    Or applied system wide with a configuration profile named com.apple.security.authorization.mobileconfig in the project''s includes folder.

    <key>PayloadType</key>

    <string>com.apple.security.authorization</string>

    <key>ignoreArd</key>

    <true/>'
