Authorization is achieved on the macOS through permissions, which are controlled at many levels, from the Mach and BSD components of the kernel, through higher levels of the operating system and, for networked applications, through the networking protocols. Permissions can be granted at the level of directories, subdirectories, files or applications, or specific data within files or functions within applications.

  name: macOS Security - Ensure the System Implements Malicious Code Protection Mechanisms
  platforms: macOS

  description: "The inherent configuration of the macOS IS in compliance as Apple has designed the system with three layers of protection against malware. Each layer of protection is comprised of one or more malicious code protection mechanisms, which are automatically implemented and which, collectively, meet the requirements of all applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for malicious code prevention.\n1. This  first layer of defense targets the distribution of malware; the aim is to prevent malware from ever launching.\nThe following mechanisms are inherent to the macOS design and constitute the first layer of protection against malicious code:\nThe Apple App Store: the safest way to add new applications to a Mac is by downloading them from the App Store; all apps available for download from the App Store have been reviewed for signs of tampering and signed by Apple to indicate that the app meets security requirements and does\
    \ not contain malware.\nXProtect: a built-in, signature-based, anti-virus, anti-malware technology inherent to all Macs. XProtect automatically detects and blocks the execution of known malware.\nIn macOS 10.15 and all subsequent releases, XProtect checks for known malicious content when:\nan app is first launched,\nan app has been changed (in the file system), and\nXProtect signatures are updated.\nYARA: another built-in tool (inherent to all Macs), which conducts signature-based detection of malware. Apple updates YARA rules regularly.\nGatekeeper: a security feature inherent to all Macs; Gatekeeper scans apps to detect malware and/or revocations of a developer's signing certificate and prevents unsafe apps from running.\nNotarization: Apple performs regular, automated scans to detect signs of malicious content and to verify developer ID-signed software; when no issues are found, Apple notarizes the software and delivers the results of scans to the system owner.\n2. The second layer\
    \ of defense targets malware that manages to appear on a Mac before it runs; the aim is to quickly identify and block any malware present on a Mac in order to prevent the malware from running and further spreading.\nThe following mechanisms are inherent to the macOS design and constitute the second layer of protection against malicious code:\nXProtect (defined above).\nGatekeeper (defined above).\nNotarization (defined above).\n3.  The third layer of defense targets infected Mac system(s); the aim is to remediate Macs on which malware has managed to successfully execute.\nThe following mechanism is inherent to the macOS design and constitutes the third layer of protection against malicious code:\n*\tApple's XProtect: a technology included on all macOS systems. XProtect will remediate infections upon receiving updated information delivered and when infections are detected\nlink:https://support.apple.com/guide/security/protecting-against-malware-sec469d47bd8/1/web/1[]\nlink:https://support.apple.com/guide/security/app-security-overview-sec35dd877d0/web[]"

  description: Organizational devices requiring unique device-to-device identification and authentication may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination of type/device. Information systems typically use either shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC] or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify/authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks. Organizations determine the required strength of authentication mechanisms by the security categories of information systems. Because of the challenges of applying this control on large scale, organizations are encouraged to only apply the control to those limited number (and type) of devices that truly need to support this capability.

  description: 'A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled
    areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.

    Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.

    Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to its network and impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system.'

  name: macOS Security - FileVault Supplemental
  platforms: macOS
  platform: darwin
  description: 'The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:

    * systemsettingsfilevaultenforce

    In macOS the internal Apple File System (APFS) data volume can be protected by FileVault. The system volume is always cryptographically protected (T2 and Apple Silicon) and is a read-only volume.

    NOTE: FileVault uses an AES-XTS data encryption algorithm to protect full volumes of internal and external storage. Macs with a secure enclave (T2 and Apple Silicon) utilize the hardware security features of the architecture.

    FileVault is described in detail here: link:https://support.apple.com/guide/security/volume-encryption-with-filevault-sec4c6dc1b6e/web[].

    FileVault can be enabled in two ways within the macOS. It can be managed using the fdesetup command or by a Configuration Profile. When enabling FileVault via either of the aforementioned methods, you will be required to enter a username and password, which must be a local Open Directory account with a valid SecureToken password.

    [discrete]

    ==== Using the fdesetup Command

    When enabling FileVault via the command line in the Terminal application, you can run the following command.

    /usr/bin/fdesetup enable

    Running this command will prompt you for a username and password and then enable FileVault and return the personal recovery key. There are a number of management features available when managing FileVault via the command line that are not available when using a configuration profile. More information on these management features is available in the man page for fdesetup.

    NOTE: Apple has deprecated fdesetup command line tool from recognizing user name and password for security reasons and may remove the ability in future versions of macOS.

    [discrete]

    ==== Using a Configuration Profile

    When managing FileVault with a configuration profile, you must deploy a profile with the payload type com.apple.MCX.FileVault2. When using the Enable key to enable FileVault with a configuration profile, you must include 1 of the following:

    <key>Enable</key>

    <string>On</string>

    <key>Defer</key>

    <true/>

    <key>Enable</key>

    <string>On</string>

    <key>UserEntersMissingInfo</key>

    <true/>

    If using the Defer key it will prompt for the user name and password at logout.

    The UserEntersMissingInfo key will only work if installed through manual installation, and it will prompt for the username and password immediately.

    When using a configuration profile, you can escrow the Recovery key to a Mobile Device Management (MDM) server. Documentation for that can be found on Apple''s Developer site: link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/fderecoverykeyescrow[].

    It''s recommended that you use a Personal Recovery key instead of an Institutional key as it will generate a specific key for each device. You can find more guidance on choosing a recover key here: link:https://docs.jamf.com/technical-papers/jamf-pro/administering-filevault-macos/10.7.1/ChoosingaRecoveryKey.html[].

    NOTE: On Intel Macs, FileVault only supports password-based unlock and cannot be done using a smartcard. Smartcard unlock for FileVault is supported on Apple Silicon Macs.'
